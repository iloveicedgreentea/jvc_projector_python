# JVC Projector Python Library

# Deprecated: use https://github.com/iloveicedgreentea/pyjvcprojector 
This implements new features, improvements, and optimizations inspired by https://github.com/bezmi/jvc_projector. This was made with NZ models in mind. Almost every function will work with NX models but I do not guarantee operability for them.

This is designed to work with my Home Assistant plugin: https://github.com/iloveicedgreentea/jvc_homeassistant

## Installation

```
# Assuming you have a venv with >=python3.11
pip install pyjvc
```

## Quick Start

Set your network password if you have an NZ model first.

```python
jvc = JVCProjector(host="ipaddr", connect_timeout=10, password="password")

# Commands are passed as a single string delimited by a comma
# open menu
cmd = jvc.exec_command(["menu, menu"])
# press left button
cmd = jvc.exec_command(["menu, left"])
# set picture mode to frame adapt HDR
cmd = jvc.exec_command(["picture_mode, frame_adapt_hdr"])
# turn on
cmd = jvc.power_on()
```

## Usage

See [quick-start](#quick-start) for importing

The commands are structured to use simple command keywords and parameters. This makes it simple to remember commands. All names with spaces will have an underscore instead.

```python
Command: low_latency
Parameter: off
code: jvc.exec_command(["low_latency, off"])
```

```python
Command: picture_mode
Parameter: hdr_plus
code: jvc.exec_command(["picture_mode, hdr_plus"])
```

You can also run multiple commands in a row by just giving it a list of commands

```python
jvc.exec_command(["picture_mode, hdr_plus", "motion_enhance, off"])
```

Use `print_commands()` to get all the latest support commands. This is dynamically generated at runtime so it is always up to date.

## Currently Supported Commands

- Power on/off
- Lens Memory/Installation Modes
- Input HDMI 1 or 2
- Power and Low Latency Status
- Low Latency Mode on/off
- Menu and arrow buttons (Menu, LRUD, back)
- Masking
- Laser power low/med/high
- Laser Dimming off/auto1/auto2
- E-shift on/off
- Aperture off/auto1/auto2
- Anamorphic modes
- And many others

## Supported Models

- NZ7/NZ8/NZ9 (Network password is required)
- NX5/NX7/NX9
- Most likely any other D-ILA projector, and possibly older models with ethernet cables.

## Home Assistant

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
remote:
  - platform: jvc_projectors
    name: nz7
    password: password
    host: 192.168.1.2
    scan_interval: 30
```

## Development

```shell
# Create venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```shell
# Edit env
cp .env.template .env
# edit .env with values
```
## Supported Commands

`$command,$parameter`
example: "anamorphic,off"
example: "anamorphic,d"
example: "laser_mode,auto3"

It also supports using remote codes as ASCII [found here](https://support.jvc.com/consumer/support/documents/DILAremoteControlGuide.pdf) (Code A only)

`jvc.emulate_remote("23")`

```
